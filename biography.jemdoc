== Biography

I obtained my Ph.D. from the [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk Department of Computer Science and Engineering],  
[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)] in 2021, 
under the supervision of [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~fyyoung/ Prof. Evangeline F.Y. Young].
Before that, I received my Bachelor Degree of Computer Science and Technology 
from [https://www.zju.edu.cn/english Zhejiang University (ZJU)].

My research interests include physical design of VLSI circuits and related ML-based problems.
